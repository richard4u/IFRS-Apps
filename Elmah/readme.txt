Microsoft SQL Server Error Log for ELMAH
========================================

In order to complete the installation of the `elmah.sqlserver` package, you
will have to execute the `SQLServer.sql` script (located in the root of
the directory where the package was installed) against your SQL Server
database. It will create the necessary database objects for the error log.
